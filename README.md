# Mapping_Earthquakes
Mapping Earthquakes using JavaScript, MapBox API, GeoJSON, and Leaflet

## Overview:
In this challenge we were given the task to use JavaScript and leaflet to map earthquakes in the past 7 days. We used Javascript and the powerful leaflet library and MapBox API to create different layers of maps to visualize the magnitude of the earthquakes and to create the different tectonic plates.

## Purpose:
The purpose of this challenge was to familiarize ourselves with another visualization tool in Leaflet. We are to familiarize ourselves with the syntax of leaflet and possibly become more familiar with accessing APIs with JavaScript. We also learned how to access JSON data files and utilize geoJSON data sets to visualize map related issues. This can be important for flights, traveling (itinerary), and ride shares to name a few.

### Results:
The results of this challenge were creating multiple layers using leaflet on top of the MapBox API

### Summary:
In summary this challenge was extremely informational and was syntax heavy. This challenge would be tougher if the module didn't include clear examples and if we had to refer to the leaflet documentation on our own. Once I had a hang of the syntax and flow of the leaflet it became easier to implement. There are so many more customization of leaflet we didn't touch on, but the beauty of leaflet is easy implementation for a sleek visualization.
